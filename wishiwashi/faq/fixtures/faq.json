        "answer": "A dry-cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine, and clothes dryer...it just much bigger. Garments are placed into a washing/extraction chamber (referred to as the basket, or drum), which is the core of the machine. The washing chamber can hold a number of garments which will be similar in colour and texture.\r\n\r\nDuring the wash cycle, the drum is partly filled with solvent and begins to rotate, agitating the clothing. Delicate items are processed at low temperatures and reduced agitation. Once the process is complete, the drum will spin-out the solvent into a filtering and distilling chamber, and the drying process will commence on your clothes. Water is not used in the process, hence the name 'dry cleaning' . The lack of water also protects your clothes from shrinkage.",
